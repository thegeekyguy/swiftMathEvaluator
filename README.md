swiftMathEvaluator
==================

This is a very simple math evaluator.  It is created for the use of solving math expressions without using javascript's
eval() function.  It does not convert an expression into infix/postfix just to evaluate it.  Instead, it recursively
calls itself in efforts to quickly and directly solve given expressions.
